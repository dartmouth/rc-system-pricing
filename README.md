## HTML and CSS Resources

This **MDN Web Docs** link has great information for both HTML and CSS. On the sidebar on the left side of the page, you will find tabs that explain HTML and CSS fundamentals. This Mozilla developer website is a great resource to familiarize yourself with as it has comprehensive documentation for many technologies.

Once you have created a `style.css` file, you can follow the instructions on this page to link your HTML and CSS files:

I have also found this **cheatsheet** to be a useful tool when it comes to styling in both HTML and CSS:

### Additional Resources
Some additional resources from **W3Schools**, another useful documentation site:
- ðŸ”— [W3Schools HTML Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- ðŸ”— [W3Schools CSS Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

Documentation websites may be overwhelming at first, but familiarity with these resources will be invaluable.
