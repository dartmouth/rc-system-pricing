## HTML and CSS Resources

This **MDN Web Docs** link has great information for both HTML and CSS. On the sidebar on the left side of the page, you will find tabs that explain HTML and CSS fundamentals. This Mozilla developer website is a great resource to familiarize yourself with as it has comprehensive documentation for many technologies.  
ðŸ”— [MDN Web Docs â€“ Core Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content)

Once you have created a `style.css` file, you can follow the instructions on this page to link your HTML and CSS files:  
ðŸ”— [MDN Web Docs â€“ Getting Started with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Getting_started)

I have also found this **cheatsheet** to be a useful tool when it comes to styling in both HTML and CSS:

### Additional Resources
Some additional resources from **W3Schools**, another useful documentation site:
- ðŸ”— [W3Schools HTML Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- ðŸ”— [W3Schools CSS Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

Documentation websites may be overwhelming at first, but familiarity with these resources will be invaluable.

### Introduction to JavaScript

I think it would be helpful moving forward for us all to create **Codecademy** accounts. There is a free **"Introduction to JavaScript"** course that has a helpful interactive interface to learn the languageâ€™s fundamentals. There are also great lessons for **Git** and **SQL** that might come in handy in the future. I have used Codecademy many times to familiarize myself with a new tool or language, and I hope you will find it useful.

Once you have created a Codecademy account, the course can be found here:  
ðŸ”— [Introduction to JavaScript â€“ Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/courses/introduction-to-javascript)

I think the first two lessons, **"Introduction to JavaScript"** and **"Variables"**, would be a good starting point. I anticipate that these two lessons will take about **an hour**.  

- Feel free to **stop early** if they are too time-consuming.  
- If you finish early, you can **try a couple of the projects or quizzes** for extra practice.
